# Advent of Code 2024 - William Trang

My repository for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/). All solutions are my own and mostly documented. Each solution was done in Python, and every problem has its own folder titled `DayXX`. Each problem folder has the following structure:
- DayXX/
  - tests/
    - input_test.txt
    - ...
  - solution.py

`solution.py` contains the source code for the solution, with `part_1` and `part_2` functions denoting the solutions of part 1 and 2 of the problem respectively. The `tests` directory contains sample inputs I used to verify my functions.
