# Advent of Code 2024 â€“ William Trang

This repository contains my personal solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024), written entirely in **Python**. All solutions are my own and are mostly documented.

Each day's problem is organized into its own folder, named `DayXX`, and follows the structure below:
- DayXX/
  - tests/
    - input_test.txt
    - ...
  - solution.py

## ðŸ“„ File Structure

- **`solution.py`**
  - Implements both parts of the problem using:
    - `part_1()` â€“ Solution to Part 1
    - `part_2()` â€“ Solution to Part 2

- **`tests/`**
  - Contains input files (e.g., `input_test.txt`) used for local testing and validation.
